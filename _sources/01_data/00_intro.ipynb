    "# AppVoC Dataset: Apple App Store Voice of the Customer at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Because we offer nearly two million apps — and we want you to feel good about using every single one of them.\" - Apple\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In 1983, Steve Jobs envisioned a future where consumers could seamlessly purchase and download software directly from their computers. Fast forward 25 years to 2008, Apple launched the App Store, realizing Jobs’ vision and revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. Following the success of the iTunes digital music store, the Apple App Store became one of the world’s first commercially successful mobile app marketplaces, and today, it stands as a digital leviathan. As of May 29, 2024, the App Store boasts a staggering 1,928,363 apps available for download, catering to over 1.3 billion iOS users worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, amidst this flourishing ecosystem, understanding how users *actually* feel about the apps they download and use every day, remains crucial. It's incontestable. Ratings and reviews play a pivotal role in App Store Optimization (ASO) and app discoverability, which can be the difference between app success and failure. Yet, the dearth of large-scale customer rating and review datasets for in-depth analysis, astounding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disaffected by the scarcity of comprehensive App Store review datasets, an undertaking was begun to construct a collection of app reviews that would serve as a laboratory where the frontier of generative methods, text synthesis, graph neural networks, next-gen NLP solutions, advanced integration technologies, and other innovative methods can be explored, stretched, taxed and charged with revealing the nuances and contours of the customer experience, to uncover the latent, and perhaps indistinguished emergent market need with AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we bridge this gap with the introduction of the AppVoC (Voice of the Customer) dataset — a collection of iOS app reviews, believed to be one of the largest collections of Apple IOS user review datasets available, second only to that of the App Store itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of AppVoC Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale**: The dataset includes a total of 18,301,035 reviews, making it one of the most extensive collections of app store reviews publicly available.\n",
    "- **User Base**: It covers 13,242,130 unique users, reflecting a vast and diverse range of perspectives.\n",
    "- **App Diversity**: The dataset includes reviews for 34,051 unique apps across 11 categories, showcasing the broad spectrum of app interests and needs.\n",
    "- **Category Coverage**: The dataset spans ten of the most popular app categories, illuminating the diverse interests and needs of mobile users.\n",
    "- **Voice-on-Voice**: The dataset captures how users engage and value the sentiments and opinions of other users. The number and value of user votes on reviews opens up new avenues allowing researchers and analysts to explore user engagement dynamics, identify influential reviews, and understand the collective sentiment of the user community towards specific apps. These insights can inform app developers, stakeholders, and decision-makers in optimizing app experiences, addressing user concerns, and driving user engagement and satisfaction.\n",
    "- **Temporal Coverage**: Spanning from 2008 to 2023, the dataset captures a wealth of user interactions and feedback over 15 years, providing a longitudinal view of app usage and user feedback trends. Timestamps illuminate the individual and collective progression of sentiment over time, motivating deeper exploration into the evolving dynamics of user engagement and feedback. By analyzing the temporal dimension of reviews, researchers and analysts can uncover trends, patterns, and fluctuations in user sentiment, shedding light on the factors influencing app popularity, user satisfaction, and overall app ecosystem dynamics. This temporal lens not only provides valuable insights into past user behavior but also enables predictive analysis and forecasting, empowering stakeholders to anticipate trends, mitigate risks, and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the ever-evolving app landscape.\n",
    "- **Rich Metadata**: Each review is accompanied by metadata such as app name, category, rating, vote count, and timestamp, enabling multifaceted analysis.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: The dataset includes pre-computed sentiment scores for each review, aiding in the understanding of user satisfaction and feedback trends.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Data Quality Assessment\n",
    "The first stage of data processing is the Data Quality Assessment. This stage is crucial for ensuring that our dataset is ready for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks. By identifying and rectifying data quality issues early, we can avoid potential pitfalls that might compromise the integrity and accuracy of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we employ a series of tasks designed to identify and address any noise or irregularities within the dataset. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of data quality, ranging from detecting duplicate entries to identifying profanity, special patterns, and other potential sources of bias or distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality Checks\n",
    "Now that are data are normalized, we proceed with a series of data quality checks to identify and address various issues:\n",
    "1. **Duplicate Rows**: We identify and remove duplicate entries to ensure that each observation is unique, preventing skewed analyses and inflated metrics.\n",
    "2. **Null Values**: We detect and handle missing data appropriately, which could involve imputation, deletion, or flagging incomplete records for further investigation.\n",
    "3. **Outliers**: Check for outliers in numeric columns using the non-parametric Interquartile Range (IQR) method.\n",
    "4. **Non-English Text**: We check for and address non-English text, as it may not be relevant to our analysis or could require special handling.\n",
    "5. **Emojis**: Emojis can carry significant meaning in certain contexts but might also introduce noise. We identify and decide on their treatment—whether to retain, remove, or translate them into textual representations.\n",
    "6. **Excessive Special Characters**: Special characters can disrupt text analysis and need to be managed, either by cleaning or encoding them appropriately.\n",
    "7. **Invalid Dates**: We verify that date values fall within expected ranges and formats, correcting or flagging anomalies for further review.\n",
    "8. **Invalid Ratings**: Ratings that fall outside the expected scale (e.g., 1 to 5) are identified and corrected or flagged.\n",
    "9. **Profanity**: We detect and handle profane content to ensure that our dataset adheres to appropriate usage standards, especially if it's intended for public or sensitive applications.\n",
    "10. **Special Patterns**: We identify and manage special patterns such as URLs, phone numbers, and emails. These patterns could be indicative of spam or need to be anonymized to protect privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By conducting these data quality checks, we ensure that our dataset is clean, reliable, and ready for detailed analysis. This foundational step sets the stage for accurate insights and robust conclusions in the subsequent phases of our data processing pipeline."
